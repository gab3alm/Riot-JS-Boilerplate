# Riot-JS-Boilerplate
This is boilerplate code for a project setup using Webpack, Riot Js, Materialize-css, Jquery, and Riot-Route.

It is just a starting point that has everything setup and ready for use.

Note: Jquery is not included in the package.json because materialize-css already has one included. 

NPM script 'dev' is used for development using Vagrant VM setup. Use script 'dev2' if you are using a regular linux machine.

Feel free to use this stuff as you please :)
